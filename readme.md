Weather Dashboard with Chatbot Integration
Project Overview
This project is a Weather Dashboard that integrates the OpenWeather API to display current weather information and a 5-day forecast for any city. The dashboard also includes proper error handling to manage invalid city names and potential API issues. Additionally, the project includes Chatbot Integration using the Dialogflow API to enhance user interaction.
The dashboard uses HTML, CSS (with CSS Grid for responsiveness), JavaScript, and API integration to fetch and display weather data. It features charts powered by Chart.js to visualize temperature trends and other weather details.

How to Run the Project Locally
Prerequisites
Before running this project locally, ensure you have the following:
1.	OpenWeather API Key: You need to sign up for an API key from the OpenWeather website.
2.	Dialogflow API Key: Sign up for Dialogflow and create a project to obtain an API key if you wish to use chatbot integration.
Instructions
Clone or Download the Repository:
o	Download the project files as a ZIP or clone the repository to your local machine.
git clone <repository-url>
API Key Setup:
o	In script.js, replace YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY with your actual OpenWeather API key.
o	If you're using the chatbot, replace YOUR_DIALOGFLOW_API_KEY with your Dialogflow key as well.
javascript
const weatherAPIKey = 'YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY';
Open the Project:
o	Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.
o	The dashboard will load, allowing you to search for weather in different cities.
Run Locally:
o	No additional server setup is required. Simply open the index.html file and start using the dashboard.
Error Handling
•	If an invalid city is entered, an error message will be displayed on the dashboard.
•	In case of any API issues, appropriate error messages will be shown, and the user can try again later.
